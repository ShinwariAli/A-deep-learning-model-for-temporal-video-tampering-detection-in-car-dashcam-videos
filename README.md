# Temporal Video Tampering Detection using 1D-CNN

This repository contains code for detecting **temporal tampering** (frame deletion, insertion, and duplication) in **car dashcam videos** using a lightweight 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN).

## Features
- Frame difference computation using OpenCV
- Sequence normalization and padding
- 1D-CNN binary classifier for tampering detection
- Works on frame **deletion**, **insertion**, and **duplication** with minor dataset changes

## Usage
